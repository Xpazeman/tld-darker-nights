* Darkness Multiplier: This is the base multiplier that will be applied to the illumination. 0 is pitch black, 1 is game default. This value will be modified by the aurora illumination and the moon phase impact options. 
* Aurora Illumination: If this is set to Yes, auroras will have an effect on night's illumination, making everything a bit more bright.
* Aurora Brightness: How much will the aurora illuminate the world. Setting this to 0 is the same as disabling aurora illumination. Recommended value is around 0.5.
* Aurora Color Saturation: How colorful will be the aurora lights. Recommended setting is between 1 and 1.5, but you can lower this if you feel it's too colorful for your taste. 0 would make the aurora light white.
* Moon phase impact: By default, moon phases do have an impact on how bright nights are, but the difference isn't that big. This makes the effect more prominent, specially when using lower Darkness Multiplier settings.

Recommended settings are Darkness Multiplier at 0, with a moon phase impact of 0.2, this way, world will be pitch black unless the moon is out, and even then, the effect will be faint unless at full moon.
